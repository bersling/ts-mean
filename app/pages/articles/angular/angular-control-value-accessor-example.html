    <h2>
      Why would you want to implement the Control Value Accessor interface?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The fact that you are here probably means that you have googled for Control Value Accessor because you had a specific need. I can imagine this need to be one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You want to make a custom form control, for example a <code>&lt;my-input&gt;&lt;/my-input&gt;</code> component, and you want to be able to use it with Angular forms (template driven or reactive forms). For example, you want to be able to write <code>&lt;my-input formControlName="age"&gt;&lt;/my-input&gt;</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        You want to be able to use ngModel with your custom component.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
      How to implement the Control Value Accessor interface
    </h2>
    <p>
      The implementation seems a bit daunting, because you'll have to do a lot of stuff that you actually don't "want" to do, and this will add quite a bit of boilerplate to your custom component. Unfortunately this is just the way it is with the CVA (Control Value Accessor). So let's get started with the parts that you can just <b>copy paste</b>, don't <i>really</i> need to understand and that will always stay the same for each and every CVA you implement.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Boilerplate (= the stuff you can just copy paste)
    </h3>
    <p>
      First, you'll need to add some weird stuff to your component annotation:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-ts">import {Component, OnInit, forwardRef} from '@angular/core';
import {ControlValueAccessor, FormControl, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR} from '@angular/forms';


@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-input',
  templateUrl: './custom-input.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./custom-input.component.scss'],

  // Step 1: copy paste this providers property
  providers: [
    {
      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
      useExisting: forwardRef(() => CustomInputComponent),
      multi: true
    }
  ]
})
// Step 2: Add "implements ControlValueAccessor"
export class CustomInputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      Also append <code class="app-code">implements ControlValueAccessor</code> in order to make sure you implement the Control Value Accessor interface correctly.
      Next, you'll need to add two methods to your class:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-ts">// Step 3: Copy paste this stuff here into your class
onChange: any = () => {}
onTouch: any = () => {}
registerOnChange(fn: any): void {
  this.onChange = fn;
}
registerOnTouched(fn: any): void {
  this.onTouch = fn;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      You don't really need to understand this in depth. It just gives Angular the means to do it's thing when setting up everything necessary for the custom form control. What's important to understand, is that <b>you don't provide implementations for the onTouch and onChange functions yourself</b>. They will be provided by Angular. What <code>onChange</code> is doing, is to write any changes inside of your component to the form control. And <code>onTouch</code> will mark a form control as dirty. What you <b>do get a say in</b> is when you want to <b>call</b> those functions. So if you never <b>call</b> onChange, the form control on the ouside will never be updated. We'll understand better how that works in the next section.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      The stuff that needs to be customized
    </h3>
    <p>
      Let's assume that we're implementing a component that revolves around a <code class="app-code">&lt;input type="text"/&gt;</code>. For a button or any other thing, that could supply us with a value to put into the formControl on the parent component, the process will be similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we'll need to add the last missing function of the Control Value Accessor interface, <code class="app-code">writeValue</code>. What you'll need to do here is to define what's happening when a new value appears on the FormControl <b>outside</b>. So for example, let's say you have <code class="app-code">username = FormControl('')</code> on the outside, and your custom form control is handling the <code class="app-code">username</code> through <code>&lt;app-custom-input [formControl]="username"&gt;&lt;/app-custom-input&gt;</code>. Now if in the parent component the username is set <i>somehow</i> (e.g. form initialized, form reset, ...), then this function will get triggered. Typically, what you'll want to do, is to write the value to a local variable:
    </p>
    <pre><code>writeValue(input: string) {
  this.input = input;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      So this means, that anytime the username changes in the parent form control, this function will get triggered with that value and you're writing that value to a local variable. Of course, you could do something else with the value, but that's what you'll do most of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now that you've defined how a <b>change on the outside is reflected on the inside</b>, you'll have to define how a <b>change on the inside is reflected on the outside</b>. For that you'll listen to changes inside of your custom component as you normally would if this weren't a Control Value Accessor. For example, if it's a button, you're listening to the click, if it's an input, you're listening to keystrokes or input changes or whatever it is that you want to listen to in your custom component. There's one key difference, and that is that you'll have to call <code class="app-code">this.onChange(...);</code> instead of <code class="app-code">this.myEventEmitter.emit(...)</code> when you want to inform the outside world about changes. When to call it is up to you, but typically you want to do this at the same point you would have called the <code class="app-code">.emit</code>. For example, you could leverage this and build an input field, that only updates the form control every 500 milliseconds. That could be useful to not spam servers with request if you have an autocomplete feature or similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in the simplest of cases, you could just trigger the onChange when something in your local form element changes:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;
       [ngModel]=&quot;input&quot;
       (ngModelChange)=&quot;onChange($event)&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can view this example here on Stackblitz:
      
      <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-control-value-accessor-simple-example-tsmean">
        https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-control-value-accessor-simple-example-tsmean
      </a>
    </p>
    The relevant code is this:
    <pre><code>import {Component, OnInit, forwardRef} from '@angular/core';
import {ControlValueAccessor, FormControl, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR} from '@angular/forms';


@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-input',
  templateUrl: './custom-input.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./custom-input.component.scss'],

  // Step 1: copy paste this providers property
  providers: [
    {
      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
      useExisting: forwardRef(() => CustomInputComponent),
      multi: true
    }
  ]
})
// Step 2: Add implements ControlValueAccessor
export class CustomInputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {

  // Step 3: Copy paste this stuff here
  onChange: any = () => {}
  onTouch: any = () => {}
  registerOnChange(fn: any): void {
    this.onChange = fn;
  }
  registerOnTouched(fn: any): void {
    this.onTouch = fn;
  }

  // Step 4: Define what should happen in this component, if something changes outside
  input: string;
  writeValue(input: string) {
    this.input = input;
  }

  // Step 5: Handle "what should happen on the outside, if something changes on the inside"
  // in this simple case, we've handled all of that in the .html
  // a) we've bound to the local variable with ngModel
  // b) we emit to the outside by calling onChange on ngModelChange

}</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Alternative: Using a FormControl</h3>
    <p>
      You could have gone a slightly different road inside of your <code>CustomInputComponent</code>. Instead of using ngModel, you could have used a form control here as well. In that case, the example would change like this:
    </p>
    <amp-accordion>
      <section>
        <h5 class="file-label-two">
          Alternative: Using a FormControl (click to show code)
        </h5>
        <pre><code>
...
export class CustomInputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor, OnDestroy {

  // Step 3: Instead of a simple string variable, use a FormControl
  input = new FormControl('')

  // Step 4: use the setValue method on the form control to update it when a new value comes in from the outside
  writeValue(input: string) {
    this.input.setValue(input);
  }

  // Step 5: Listen to value changes on the form control. If something happens, the function provided by Angular will be called and the outside world will be informed.
  subscriptions = [];
  registerOnChange(fn: any): void {
    this.subscriptions.push(
      this.input.valueChanges.subscribe(fn)
    );
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.subscriptions.forEach(sub => sub.unsubscribe());
  }
  
  // Step 6: onTouch stays the same
  onTouch: any = () => {}
  registerOnTouched(fn: any): void {
    this.onTouch = fn;
  }

}</code></pre>
      </section>
    </amp-accordion>
    
    <p>
      and the html
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;
       [formControl]=&quot;input&quot;
       (blur)=&quot;onTouch()&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      I actually think the alternative approach using a form control could be kind of nice, especially the html template gets simpler. The only problem is that we're introducing a pesky subscription which we'll then have to unsubscribe from in the onDestroy.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Lazy Input
    </h3>
    <p>
      A lazy input can be useful, if you want to program something like an autocomplete. Like this, the form control would only be updated once in a while and the server wouldn't be spammed with requests. Here's the code:
    </p>
    <amp-accordion>

import {debounceTime} from 'rxjs/operators';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-input',
  templateUrl: './custom-input.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./custom-input.component.scss'],

  // Step 1: copy paste this providers property
  providers: [
    {
      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
      useExisting: forwardRef(() => CustomInputComponent),
      multi: true
    }
  ]
})
// Step 2: Add "implements ControlValueAccessor"
export class CustomInputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor, OnInit {

  @Input() debounceTime = 500;

  // Step 3: Copy paste this stuff here
  onChange: any;
  onTouch: any;
  registerOnChange(fn: any): void {
    this.onChange = fn;
  }
  registerOnTouched(fn: any): void {
    this.onTouch = fn;
  }

  // Step 4: Define what should happen in this component, if something changes outside
  writeValue(input: string) {
    this.input.next(input);
  }

  // Step 5: Handle what should happen on the outside, if something changes on the inside
  input = new ReplaySubject(1);
  onInputChange(input: string) {
    this.input.next(input);
  }
  subscriptions: Subscription[] = [];
  ngOnInit() {
    this.subscriptions.push(
      this.input
        .pipe(
          debounceTime(1000)
        )
        .subscribe(input => {
          this.onChange(input);
        })
    )
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.subscriptions.forEach(sub => sub.unsubscribe());
  }

    <h3>
      Button Example
    </h3>
    <p>
      Another classic in the world of examples is the button increasing a counter. So if your custom form element revolves around a button, choose this as an orientation. Here's the code:

  writeValue(counter: number) {
    console.log(`writeValue is called with ${counter}.`)
    this.counter = counter;

    <h3>
      Nested Forms
    </h3>
    <p>
      Should you use Control Value Accessor for nested forms? The answer is <b>NO, NO, NO</b>!
      I first made this mistake as well, but if you think about it, it's <b>not at all</b> what the CVA is made for.
      The CVA is made for scenarios where you wrap a <b>form control</b> in a component, not a <b>form group</b>.
      If you wrap a form group in a component, then you can just pass in the form group!
    </p>
    <p>
      Say you have a form that looks like this: <code class="app-code">{name: string; address: {street: string; zip: number;}}</code>.
      The address part you deem is worthy of it's own component.
      Then you can just pass in the sub form into the child component!
      Here's what the <code class="app-code">AddressFormComponent</code> would look like:
    </p>

        <h5 class="file-label-two">

  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; formControlName=&quot;street&quot; placeholder=&quot;Street&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; formControlName=&quot;zip&quot; placeholder=&quot;Zip&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
          <div>and in the parent component</div>

  });

    <h2>
      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
      Implementing the Control Value Accessor interface isn't rocket science, but since you'll have to add a lot of boilerplate code and still understand the basics of what's going on, it's quite confusing at first.
      However, I hope I could clear up some of the confusion around Control Value Accessor and illustrate how to use it with some examples!
