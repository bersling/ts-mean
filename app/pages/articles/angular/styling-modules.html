  What's the worst that can happen when getting this wrong?
  - my open source tools arent used
  - we need to rewrite a lot 
  - it takes a lot of time to write and debug



  The options:

  1) just use js...

  Pros:
  - SIMPLE for the client: just configure in forRoot!!!

  Cons:
  - It's pretty impossible to override an ng-style
  - Performance, but unlikely unless you have thousands of objects...
  - Client needs color vars etc in JS
  - You'll need to create a "ConfigService" and style stuff with JS

  2) include theme, apply theme
  Pros:
  - It is probably the technically most sophisticated option

  Cons:
  - It's frekin complicated to program

  3) simply add classes, which enable you in your global styles to do some overrides

  task {
    .task-header {
      background: red;
    }
  } in styles.scss

  4) @import 'variables'
  
  Cons:
  - you'll have globals
  - file needs to be named 'variables' -> sucks

  
  5) !default
  Pros
  - Bootstrap does it like this

  Cons:
  - It doesn't work with Angular Component Styles
  - Also has global character
