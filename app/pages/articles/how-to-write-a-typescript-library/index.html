    <h2>How to write a typescript library</h2>
    
    <p>
      Writing modular code is a good idea. And nothing is more modular than writing a library.
      How can you write a typescript library? Well, that's exactly what this website is about!
      This tutorial is from <b>mid 2017</b> and written for <b>Typescript 2.x</b>!
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 1</span>: Setup tsconfig.json</h2>
    <p>
      Create a project folder, in this tutorial we'll call it <code>typescript-library</code>.
      Then proceed to create a <code>tsconfig.json</code> in <code>typescript-library</code>.
      Your <code>tsconfig.json</code> file should look somewhat like this:
    </p>
    
    <div class="file-label">typescript-library/tsconfig.json</div>
    <pre>{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es5",
    <span class="highlight">"declaration": true,</span>
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*"
  ]
}</pre>
    
    <p>
      Pretty much like a setup for a non-library project, but with one important addition:
      You need to add the "<span class="highlight">declaration: true</span>" flag. This will generate the
      typings required for the consumers to use this library.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      <span class="step">Step 2</span>: Implement your library
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Proceed as you would if you wouldn't write a library. Create a <code>src</code> folder
      and in that <code>src</code> folder all the files that make up your heart of your library.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For this  demo, we'll setup a silly <code>hello-world.ts</code> file, that looks like so:
    </p>
    
    <div class="file-label">typescript-library/src/hello-world.ts</div>
    <pre>export namespace HelloWorld {
  export function sayHello() {
    console.log('hi')
  }
  export function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log('goodbye')
  }
}
</pre>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 3</span>: Create an index.ts file</h2>
    
    <p>
      Add an <code>index.ts</code> file to your <code>src</code> folder.
      The purpose of it is to export all the parts of the library you want to make available for consumers.
      In our case it would simply be:
    </p>
    
    <div class="file-label">typescript-library/src/index.ts</div>
    <pre>export {HelloWorld} from './hello-world'</pre>
    
    <p>
      The consumer would be able to use the library later on like so:
    </p>
    
    <div class="file-label">someotherproject/src/somefile.ts</div>
    <pre>import {HelloWorld} from '<span class="highlight">hwrld</span>'
HelloWorld.sayHello();
</pre>
    
    <p>
      You see that we have a new name here, "hwrld",
      we haven't seen anywhere yet.
      What is this name?
      It's the name of the library you're gonna publish to npm also known as the <span class="highlight">package name</span>!
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 4</span>: Configure package.json</h2>
    
    <p>
      The package name is what the consumer going to use in the imports later on,
      so I prefer to not have it too long and if possible with no hyphens since it's easiest
      just to type a string when declaring the library as an import
      (an the consumers editor doesn't have auto-import). If you have to type
      <code>import * as typescript-library from 'my-crazy-library-name'</code> each time, it's not so pleasant.
      For this demo I have have chosen <code>hwrld</code> since it was still available on npm.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The package name
      is usually right at the top of the <code>package.json</code>, so the package.json. The whole <code>package.json</code>
      would look like so:
    </p>
    
    
    <div class="file-label">typescript-library/package.json</div>
    <pre>{
  "name": "hwrld",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Can log \"hello world\" and \"goodbye world\" to the console!",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  <span class="highlight">"types": "dist/index.d.ts"</span>
}
</pre>
    
    <p>
      If you don't have a package yet you can create one with <code>npm init</code> and it will guide you through the process.
      Remember, the package name you choose will be the one people later use in their imports, so choose wisely!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There's also one all-important flag in this package.json: You
      have to declare where to find the type declarations!
      This is done using <span class="highlight">"types": "dist/index.d.ts"</span>
      Otherwise the consumer won't find your module!
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 5</span>: Configure .npmignore</h2>
    
    <div class="">
      When you look at your package when loading it from npm,
      you'll notice that it contains the dist AND the src folder.
      However, you don't really need the source folder,
      as the compiled files along with the typings (.d.ts files)
      live in the dist folder. Thus you can create an .npmignore
      file. In our case it's simple:
    </div>
    
    <div class="file-label">
      typescript-library/.npmignore
    </div>
    <pre>tsconfig.json
src</pre>
    
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 6</span>: Publish to npm</h2>
    
    <p>
      To publish your first version to npm run:
    </p>
    
    <pre>tsc
npm publish
</pre>
    
    
    <p>
      Now you're all set to go! Consume your library anywhere you want by running:
    </p>
    
    <pre>npm install --save hwrld</pre>
    
    <p>
      
      and consume it using
    
    </p>
    
    <pre>import {HelloWorld} from 'hwrld'
HelloWorld.sayHello();</pre>
    
    <p>
      For subsequent releases, use the semvar principle. When you make a patch / bugfix to your library, you can run <code>npm version patch</code>,
      for new features run <code>npm version minor</code> and on breaking changes of your api run <code>npm version major</code>.

      The above tutorial contains all the steps necessary to build & publish a working library.
      However, you should probably also include some unit tests and you might want to test the behavior of your library
      locally first, without publishing.
