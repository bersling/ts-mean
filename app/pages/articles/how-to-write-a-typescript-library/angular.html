    <h2>How to write an Angular library</h2>
    
    <p>
      <i>
        This tutorial is from mid 2017 and works for Angular 2, Angular 4 and Angular 5.
      </i>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since AngularCLI nor any of the official Angular resources
      offer a straightforward way, I've composed my own tutorial on how to write an Angular library.
      <b>Note: This tutorial describes how to publish typescript sources to npm. The library will only
        work for Angular projects written in typescript!</b>
      Since Angular 5,
      this requires one more step from the consumer of the library, which could make this approach not ideal for everyone.
      Also, the consuming project needs kind of the same TypeScript settings. E.g. you can't write a library with "noImplicitAny": false and then use it in a project that has "noImplicityAny": true. <b>
      That makes this approach mostly suitable for company internal
      libraries.
    </b>
      I don't compile to javascript
      plus d.ts files, because after hours of trying I was on the brink
      of throwing my notebook out the window. It was too annoying with rollup, umd,
      MyLibraryModule not found, index.ts names, long waiting times with "yarning" and "ng serving",
      inlineing html and css, crazy tsconfig.json's with deprecated flags, no good local development environment, working version
      in local project but breaking when published and so on. So instead I decided instead just to publish TypeScript source code. If you want to write a famous library for the community, you sould probably use something like
      <a href="https://github.com/jvandemo/generator-angular2-library">https://github.com/jvandemo/generator-angular2-library</a>.
      But you can always start with something simple like this approach and migrate to something else later, maybe there will also be an official way provided until you need it.
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 1:</span> Create a new project with the AngularCli</h2>
    <p>
      Create a new project. This will be a wrapper and consumer for your library module.
      I am going to call my library <code>libex</code> (for "library-example", and it was still free on npm)
      so I call the new project <code>libex-project</code>
    </p>
    <pre>ng new libex-project  <span class="highlight">--prefix libex</span></pre>
    
    <p>
      Use your library title instead of libex. Prefix is what you'll write in front of your components, for example
      if I have a <code>HelloComponent</code> it will be used by <code>libex-hello</code> now.
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 2:</span> Create a new module</h2>
    
    <p>
      Your library will reside in it's own module. But first we've got to create said module.
    </p>
    
    <pre>ng g module libex</pre>
    
    <p>Then we <code>cd</code> into that folder.</p>
    
    <pre><code>cd src/app/libex/</code></pre>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 3:</span> Build your library module</h2>
    <p>Create components, services etc., e.g.</p>
    
    <pre>ng g component hello</pre>
    
    <p>When you're done, you'll have to <strong class="highlight">export</strong> the desired components:</p>
    
    <pre>@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: [HelloComponent],
  <span class="highlight">exports: [HelloComponent]</span>
})</pre>
    <p>You can use your <code>AppModule</code> to test the library:</p>
    <pre><code>...
imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  LibexModule
],</code></pre>
    <p>If you need singleton services, you should modify your library module like so:</p>
    <pre>@NgModule({
  providers: [ /* Don't add the services here */ ]
})
export class LibexModule {
  static forRoot() {
    return {
      ngModule: LibexModule,
      providers: [ SomeService ]
    }
  }
}</pre>
    <p>and change the imports in <code>AppModule</code> to:</p>
    <pre><code>...
imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  LibexModule.forRoot()
],</code></pre>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 4:</span> Publish</h2>
    
    <p>
      In your module folder, create a new <code>package.json</code>. You could do this with the <code>npm init</code>
      command. It should look somewhat like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre>{
  "name": "libex",
  "version": "1.0.16",
  "description": "An Example Library.",
      ...
}
</pre>
    
    <p>
      Basically only the library name matters. <b>Also rename <code>libex.module.ts</code> to <code>index.ts</code>
      since that's the standard name for a main file.</b>
      Now since we're just publishing the typescript sources (note: that means your library will only work for
      consumers that <b>also</b> use typescript), we're ready to publish. Just run <code>npm publish</code>!
      You can also add a <code>.npmignore</code> so you publish only exactly what's needed, it works like .gitignore,
      just for npm.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What's also an option is to re-export some files from index.ts. For example <code>export * from './hello.service'</code>,
      since then the consumer can just write <code>import { HelloService } from 'libex'</code> instead of
      <code>import { HelloService } from 'libex/hello.service'</code>. On the other hand, this can also
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38000323/3022127">lead to problems</a>,
      so I usually refrain from it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In case your library requires other libraries, you can also install them in your library module's folder and to
      the <code>package.json</code> we've just created. Just run <code>npm install --save something</code> from
      the library folder.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For subsequent releases, <code>npm version patch</code> (or <code>minor</code> or <code>major</code>) and then <code>npm publish</code>.
    </p>
  
    <h2><span class="step">Step 5:</span> Consuming your library</h2>
    
    <p>
      You can either install your library by downloading it from npm with <code>npm i -S your-library</code>
      or you can use <a href=""><code>npm link</code></a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To install with <code>npm link</code>, you'll need to run Angular with the --preserve-symlinks option. You
      can also specify this in your <code>.angular-cli.json</code>:
    </p>
    
<pre>"defaults": {
  ...
  "build": {
    "preserveSymlinks": true
  }
}</pre>
    
    <p>
      Another thing you'll have to do, starting with Angular 5, is to include your files. So in the tsconfig.json
      you'll need:
    </p>
    
<pre>"include": [
  "src/**/*",
  “node_modules/your-library/index.ts",
]</pre>
    
    <p>
      Well and that's it, now you have your library, which you can develop & test locally
      and publish to npm!
    </p>
