    <h2>Why and when do you need Oauth 2?</h2>
    <p>
      OAuth 2 is a protocol that enables apps to act on behalf of users. There are many potential use cases for this.
      Maybe you want to build an app that lets a person know how many facebook likes they've got over their lifetime.
      But how does facebook know that your app can get a user's data? That's where OAuth 2 comes into play.
    </p>
    <p>
      OAuth 2 is the successor of OAuth 1. It's not backwards compatible and should be seen as a completely new protocol.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    
    <h2>
      OAuth 2 Roles
    </h2>
    <p>
      So as you could see from the introduction, there are (at least) three parties involved in the process:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The user - also referred as <b>"Resource Owner"</b>. This is typically <!-- FIXME: always ? --> a human who has an account for a certain service,
        let's stick with the example of facebook.
      </li>
      <li>
        facebook itself is the <b>Resource Server</b>, but also the <b>Authorization Server</b>.
        facebook will provide authorization to the user or to app and once authorization is granted, they will send the resource.
        We'll also call it service provider here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then we have the third party app, because of which we're doing the whole OAuth 2 stuff in the first place.
        This is referred to as the <b>Client</b>. We'll also call it third party app here.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Registration of the Third Party App</h2>
    <p>
      First, in order for all of this to work, the third party app must be registered with the service provider.
      In particular, the third party app must provide a redirect URL, where the service provider should redirect the user
      to after a successful authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the service provider accepts the third party apps registration, it will provide it with
      a <b>Client ID</b> and a <b>Client Secret</b>. The Client ID is a public string that is used
      by the service provider to identify the client. The Client Secret lets the service provider verify that
      a client is really who it says it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's stick with our example of an application that reads the number of facebook likes from a user. We'll call it "likey".
      Then a likey-employee goes to facebook.com and signs up likey for OAuth 2 at facebook. If the form is accepted,
      the employee receives the <code class="app-code">client-id: likey-app</code> and <code class="app-code">client-secret: 84HAu1jdjjfXuquq</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      OAuth 2 Authorization (Grant Type: Authorization Code)
    </h2>
    <p>
      So now, how does facebook know that our third party app can access the data of "hans@gmail.com"?
      Hans somehow needs to tell facebook "hey guys, it's ok that &lt;insert application name here&gt; accesses (parts of) my data."
    </p>
    <p>
      facebook can <b>grant access</b> to likey in different ways, but the most common is the <b>Grant Type: Authorization Code</b>.
      This grant type is suited for third party applications, that have web servers themselves. The authorization code that is
      provided should not be exposed to the user directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what's the series of events that need to happen here such that likey gains access to the users facebook data?
    </p>
    <h3>
      Step 1: Authorization Code Link
    </h3>
    <p>
      The user visits the likey page. likey has placed a link on their page that points to the facebook oauth endpoint that looks something like:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://api.facebook.com/oauth-2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=likey-app&redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL&scope=read_likes</code></pre>
    <p>
      As you can see, the user is directed <b>away</b> from the likey page to the facebook page. But the link <b>also</b> contains the information
      where the user should be redirected <b>after</b> a successful authentication in the <code class="app-code">redirect_uri</code> parameter.
      The <b>scope</b> request parameter declares for which part of the service provider access is asked for. For example,
      you might want to grant likey access to how many likes you have on posts, but it shouldn't be allowed to view your friends
      or to write posts on your behalf.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Step 2: User Authorizes Application
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once the user clicks the link, he or she is leaving likey (for the moment) on being routed to the facebook page.
      What happens there, stays between the user and facebook. This is important, because the user doesn't
      want to share his or her facebook password with likey. facebook then asks the user (once he or she is authenticated / logged in)
      if he or she wants to grant access to the third party app for a certain scope (for example: read likes).
      The user can then accept or deny this.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Step 3: Application Receives Authorization Code
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the user clicks on "Authorize", the service provider (facebook) redirects the user back to the third party app (likey).
      In the redirect url, facebook will also put the <code class="app-code">Authorization Code</code>:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://www.likey.com/oauth-callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE</code></pre>
    
    <h3>
      Step 4: Application Requests Access Token
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that likey has the Authorization Code, it uses that code to get an <code class="app-code">Access Token</code>.
      To do so, it sends a POST request to an endpoint provided by facebook, which could look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://api.facebook.com/oauth-2/token?client_id=likey-app&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL</code></pre>
    <p>
      Again there are <code class="app-code">client_id</code> and <code class="app-code">redirect_uri</code> redirect parameters.
      Additionally, the <code class="app-code">client_secret</code> is provided.
<!--      FIXME: explain why this is necessary ... -->
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Step 5: Application Receives Access Token
    </h3>
    <p>
      If everything matches, facebook sends back a token that can be used by likey to access certain resources on behalf of the user.
      That response might look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>{
   "access_token": "XYZ",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "expires_in": 2592000,
   "scope": "read_likes",
   "uid": 55
}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Now likey can send a request to facebook like this:
  </p>
    <pre><code>
POST to

api.facebook.com/get-likes

// body
{uid: 55}

// HTTP Headers
Authorization: 'bearer XYZ'
    </code></pre>
    
<!--  TODO: why is some of this necessary? Why so many roundtrips  -->
