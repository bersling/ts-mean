      Authorization and Authentication. They sound almost the same, they both start with the letters <b>auth</b> and both end with <b>ation</b>.
      So what's the difference? And how can you remember the difference?
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Authentication
    </h2>
    <p>
      Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of someone or something. If you are logging in into a platform,
      you are authenticating yourself. Commonly with a username and a password, but there are also multi factor authentications,
      such as using a mobile phone for added security.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can you remember this? You know the word <b>authentic</b>. You know it means <b>somebody is himself</b>.
      Then it's easy to remember that authentication means to prove that you are who you claim to be!
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Authorization
    </h2>
    <p>
      With authorization a system already knows who you are, but it still needs to check if <b>you are permitted to do something</b>.
      For example, I might be logged in as <b>hans@gmail.com</b> into some platform, but that still doesn't mean I'm an admin and can call
      <b>/api/drop-all-tables</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to remember? This word also appears in common language, for example on signs like "only for authorized personnel".
      You can also remember that <b>YOU SHALL NOT PASS = You are unauthorized to pass</b>. Gandalf knows who you are,
      but still thinks it's a bad idea for you to pass.
