  Let's say you've written your node server and run it with forever. So it's always up and running. Right? Wrong.
</p>
<p>
  You can easily run into scenarios, where your server constantly crashes. For example, see those server logs from an actual example:
</p>
<pre class="app-pre">
  error: <span class="highlight">Script restart attempt #61</span>
  path.js:7
  throw new TypeError('Path must be a string. Received ' + inspect(path));
  ^
  
  TypeError: Path must be a string. Received undefined

  error: Forever detected script exited with code: 1
</pre>
<p>
  What was happening here? Each time the server tried to restart, it immediately crashed anew. This was due to <b>one</b> single javascript error! The problem in the code was
</p>
<pre class="app-pre">
  path.relative(__dirname, randomFile)
</pre>
<p>
  where <code>randomFile</code> was undefined. One way to fix this would be to just make sure <code>randomFile</code>
  isn't undefined. Problem <i>dodged</i>. The more general problem is: how can we avoid the server to crash?! We want high availability so that we can sleep well at night and not have a server that's down when we wake up in the morning.
