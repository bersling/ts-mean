      <strong>Learning Mustache</strong> is <strong>a lot </strong>faster if you understand properly what it's all about
      and learn the underlying concepts. You'll grasp a firmer understanding of Mustache by going through this tutorial,
      than by directly diving into the official docs, which often seem confusing at first.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Mustache?</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing to learn is that Mustache is <strong>NOT a templating engine</strong>. Mustache is<strong> a
      specification for a templating language</strong>. This specification can be found
      <a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html">here</a>, but don't read that just yet. You're not ready yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is, that you write <strong>templates</strong> that adhere to the Mustache specification, that then can be
      <strong>compiled / rendered</strong> to create an output.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What's a Templating Language and what's it for?</h3>
    <p>
      Let's say you want to send the same email to 100 people, except you want to personalize the salutation with their
      respective first names. You could replace the first name by some <strong>placeholder</strong>:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre">Dear *|FNAME|*

I hearby blablabla ...</pre>
    <p>
      Here I have invented (=stolen it from Mailchimp) a <strong>syntax for a</strong> <strong>placeholder</strong>:
      *|FNAME|*
    </p>
    <p>
      The mustache syntax looks a bit different. This case would be covered by the following template:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre">Dear {{fname}}

I hearby blablabla ...</pre>
    <p>
      As you can see, in Mustache we have <strong>curly braces</strong> for placeholders, which look like a mustache
      when
      rotated 90 degrees clockwise:
    </p>
    
    <amp-img class="aligncenter app-row-img"
             layout="responsive"
             src="/assets/img/the-ultimate-mustache-tutorial/mustache-logo.png"
             alt=""
             style="max-width: 412px;"
             width="412"
             height="157">
    </amp-img>
    
    <p>
      Hence the name of the language. There's more to the Mustache than that, but before diving any deeper into the
      language, it's useful to first cover another concept.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      By simply having specified a templating language and having written a template doesn't produce 100 emails for me.
      Much like with a programming language, just learning the language doesn't actually mean you know how to run a
      program. For example you might read in your first JavaScript tutorial that " <code>var x = 5 + 3</code> ;" is
      JavaScript, but you might not know exactly how you could run the code. Similarly with Mustache, you might learn
      about the language in a tutorial, but have no idea how to actually convert your templates to an output. Or to put
      it
      differently: How the heck can I create my 100 emails from 1 single Mustache template? You'll need a ...
    </p>
    
    <h3>Templating Engine</h3>
    <p>
      So once a syntax aka. templating language is defined, you need <strong>a tool that</strong> <strong>fills the
      placeholders in the template(s) with actual data and produces an output</strong>. This is called a templating
      engine:
    </p>
    
    <amp-img class="app-row-img"
             src="/assets/img/the-ultimate-mustache-tutorial/templating_language_vs_templating_engine-1.png"
             alt=""
             layout="responsive"
             style="max-width: 371px;"
             width="371"
             height="425">
    </amp-img>
    
    <p>
      To strech this point again, Mustache is <strong>not </strong>the templating engine. It's the
      <strong>specification</strong> for how the <strong>template file </strong>must look like.
    </p>
    
    <amp-img class="app-row-img"
             src="/assets/img/the-ultimate-mustache-tutorial/templating_language_vs_templating_engine-2.png"
             alt=""
             layout="responsive"
             style="max-width: 353px"
             width="353"
             height="405">
    </amp-img>
    
    <p>
      Or to come back to the example with programming languages. Mustache is the language. Not the execution
      environment.
      You can learn about the language in a book. But to actually use the language, you'll need a computer and something
      that can interpret and run your code. The programming language JavaScript, for example can be ran and interpreted
      by
      Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari, but they all use a different underlying <strong>engine </strong>to
      interpret and run it.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What's the Templating Engine for Mustache?</h2>
    <p>
      Like for JavaScript there, isn't just one thing that can compile Mustache. <strong>There's a multitude of tools
      out
      there that can take a Mustache Template, some input data, and produce an output. </strong>The multitude of tools
      is
      actually overwhelming. There are tools that do their job well. And then there are obsolete ones that are badly
      maintained and don't actually adhere to the Mustache specification. So which one should you choose from the
      multitude of options? The answer is: It depends on where and how you want to use Mustache. I will make some
      examples
      here, but I encourage you not to get lost in the actual links to those tools, but rather stick with the tutorial.
      When you leave now, you'll be into the nitty gritty of how to use <strong>one tool </strong>without having the
      greater picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 1</strong>: You have a Java server and want to send out emails to users. So you use our Mustache
      Template from above for the emails and extend it a bit. So now you'd like to tell your Java code "hey, I've got a
      mustache template and 3 users that go by the name of ["Hans", "Gertrude", "Fritz"], can you send them a welcome
      mail"? Then your best bet would be to use the <strong>most popular Mustache Engine written in Java</strong>:
      <a href="https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java">https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java</a> . Why? Because
      you
      have the <strong>data </strong>already in your Java code. The Mustache template file you can load through regular
      I/O:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="app-pre">// DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK THAT WAY, BUT WAS EASIER TO ILLUSTRATE
String[] users = {"Hans","Gertrude","Fritz"};
for (String user : users) {
  String renderedEmail = mf.compile("emailTemplate.mustache", user);
  // ...then send email to user...
}</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 2</strong>: You have a Python server and want to send an E-Mail. Pretty much the same as above,
      except that you'd use the <strong>most popular Mustache Engine written for Python</strong>:
      <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/pystache">https://github.com/defunkt/pystache</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 3: </strong>You just want to print 100 personalized invitations to your birthday party, but have
      no
      idea about coding whatsoever (which is obvious, since coders don't have 100 friends). Then unfortunately Mustache
      is
      not a good choice for you, since literally all engines for Mustache are connected to a <strong>programming
      language</strong>. There isn't such a thing that takes an excel list of invitees<strong> </strong>plus a Mustache
      template and generates 100 pdfs out of it.<em> </em>At least I haven't found something like that. Even though in
      principle it would work since it's just a case of [Template + Input Data = Output] there just aren't enough people
      that want to build their birthday cards that way...
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, this example 3 was really educational. We've learned that all available Mustache engines are <strong>connected
      to programming languages</strong>. Which ones are the available languages?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a screenshot from the official Mustache page answering that question:
    </p>
    <amp-img class="app-row-img"
             layout="responsive"
             src="/assets/img/the-ultimate-mustache-tutorial/available-mustache-languages.png"
             width="1256"
             height="680">
    </amp-img>
    <p>
      Okay, that's quite a lot of implementations. As I mentioned, some are good, some are bad. For example, there was
      one listed for "node.js" which wasn't maintained and was quite buggy, while the one under "JavaScript" actually
      also supports node.js. They now removed the bad one from the list, but as you can see this list isn't the be-all
      end-all. Maybe some of the listed links are outdated. Maybe some other ones are not included. At the same time,
      it's still the best list that I'm aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now that we've covered the conceptual basics, we can dive deeper into the Mustache Templating language. But
      let's
      first repeat what we've learned so far:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mustache is a templating language, not a templating engine</li>
      <li>There are tons of implementations for mustache engines, but be careful when choosing since not all are good.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Learning the Mustache Template Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      Now for the rest of the tutorial you have two choices. Either you select a templating engine from above and learn
      how it works. Then you can actually test the examples on your machine, which makes it a bit more tangible. But
      since
      Mustache is just a language, you might also be lying at a beach right now, slurping your drink, and reading the
      rest
      of the tutorial.
    </p>
    
    <h3>The Basics</h3>
    <p>
      We already have seen our very first template above, but let's repeat it in a similar fashion because it was so
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mustache Template:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hello {{planet}}</span></pre>
    <p>
      Input Data:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #0000ff;">{</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">  "planet": "Earth"</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">}</span></pre>
    <p>
      We choose JSON to describe our data here, but this would depend on the engine you're using. If you throw the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mustache template</span> plus the <span style="color: #0000ff;">input data</span> at a templating engine, it should (if it's not buggy) produce the following <span style="color: #339966;">output</span>:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #339966;">Hello Earth</span></pre>
    <p>
      So the templating engine <b>replaces</b> (also known as <b>expands</b>) the <b>tags</b> (the curly brace things) with what it finds in the input data. If in the template it's written: <code>{{someVariableName}}</code>, the engine will search the input data for the key "someVariableName" and replace the tag with the value it finds for this key. Here, "planet" was the lookup key and "Earth" was the value the engine found for this key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, depending on your chosen templating engine, the output might be stored in a variable of your program or written to the
      filesystem.
      For example, the JavaScript mustache engine has two modes: Either it can be used as a command line tool to produce
      files, or it could be used to dynamically render html files.
    </p>

    <h3>Conditionals</h3>
    <p>
      In Mustache, there are no if and else statements and also no loops. That's why they call it logic-less templating.
      At least they're <strong>not directly represented as keywords in the templating language</strong>. It is however
      possible to conditionally show or hide a block of text. And this is how:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mustache Template:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hello
{{#myCondition}}</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">  la di da</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">{{/myCondition}}</span></pre>
    Data:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #0000ff;">{</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">  "myCondition": false</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">}</span></pre>
    Output:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #339966;">Hello</span></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, this syntax might look a bit weird to you. But it get's clearer once we read those sections from the
      docs, which I have changed slightly:
    </p>
    <blockquote>[Mustache] works by expanding <b>tags</b> in a template using values provided in a hash or object. [...]
      A <b>section</b> begins with a pound and ends with a slash. That is, {{#person}} begins a "person" section while
      {{/person}} ends it. If the person key exists and has a value of false or an empty list, the <b>[content]
        between</b> the pound and slash will not be displayed. [...] If the person key exists and has a non-false value,
      the [content] between the pound and slash will be rendered and displayed.
    </blockquote>
    
    <h3>Loops through Arrays / Lists</h3>
    <p>
      Loops are also not represented directly in the mustache language, but indirectly via the data and how the mustache
      specification specifies behaviour when the data is an array.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Data:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #0000ff;">{</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">  "users": ["Hans", "Fritz", "Geraldine"]</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">}</span></pre>
    Mustache Template:
    <pre class="app-pre" style="color: red">{{#users}}
{{.}}
{{/users}}</pre>
    Output:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #339966;">Hans</span>
<span style="color: #339966;">Fritz</span>
<span style="color: #339966;">Geraldine</span></pre>
    If you want all names on the same line, you'll have to write {{#users}}{{.}} {{/users}} on one line in the template
    (and put a space in there for legibility).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The elements could also be objects instead of strings, in which case access is given by just writing the property
      names into the braces:
    </p>
    
    Data:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #0000ff;">{</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">  "users": [{
    "name": "Hans"
  }, {
    "name": "Fritz"
  }, {
    "name": "Geraldine"
  }]</span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">}</span></pre>
    Mustache Template:
    <pre class="app-pre" style="color: #ff0000;">{{#users}}
{{name}}
{{/users}}</pre>
    Output:
    
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #339966;">Hans</span>
<span style="color: #339966;">Fritz</span>
<span style="color: #339966;">Geraldine</span></pre>
    
    <h3>Using templates inside of templates: "Partials"</h3>
    One Mustache template can load another template. The specification states that this should work with the syntax
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am a template and I'm loading</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">{{&gt; template2 }}</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">and now I continue</span></pre>
    This works fine as long as template2 doesn't require template1, then you'll get an infinite recursion which your
    templating engine can't handle.
    
    <h4>Passing Data to Partials</h4>
    Passing data to partials is actually a bit tricky and one of the things that took me the longest to figure out. It
    works like this:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #ff0000;">{{#buttonOne}}
  {{&gt; mybutton}}
{{/buttonOne}}
{{#buttonTwo}}
  {{&gt; mybutton}}
{{/buttonTwo}}</span></pre>
    and in the
    <span style="font-family: Monaco, Consolas, 'Andale Mono', 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;">
      <span style="font-size: 15px;">data</span>
    </span>
    youâ€™d specify
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #0000ff;">{
  "buttonOne": {
    "title": "Cancel"
  },
  "buttonTwo": {
    "title": "Save"
  }
}</span></pre>
    In the partial there could be the code
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&lt;button class="my-cool-button"&gt;{{title}}&lt;/button&gt;</span></pre>
    The result would print
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #339966;">&lt;button class="my-cool-button"&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class="my-cool-button"&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
</span></pre>
    <p>
      You can think about it like this: The surrounding <code>{{#buttonOne}}...{{/buttonOne}}</code> is setting the <b>context</b>
      to <code>buttonOne</code> in the input data. Then the partial inherits this context and replaces the variable
      <code>title</code> accordingly.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>
      Comments begin with an exclamation point and are ignored. The following template:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #ff0000;">&lt;h1&gt;Hello{{! ignore me }}.&lt;/h1&gt;</span></pre>
    Will render as follows:
    <pre class="app-pre"><span style="color: #339966;">&lt;h1&gt;Hello.&lt;/h1&gt;</span></pre>
    Comments may contain newlines.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Further reading</h3>
    <p>
      There are some concepts we haven't discussed here, such as for example Lambdas. If you want to learn about those
      concepts, I suggest you head over to the
      <a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html">Original Mustache Specs</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>An Example with an Actual Templating Engine</h2>
    <p>
      So now that we've learned a bit about the mustache <b>language</b>, it is time that we also look at an example of
      a templating engine. After all, just knowing the language usually isn't your goal, you want to be able to use the
      language to get a job done. And the templating engine gets the job done, once you provide it with a template and
      the input data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take the JavaScript templating engine found here https://github.com/janl/mustache.js, since Mustache seems
      to be most commonly used together with JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you'd get started by installing the templating engine like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre">mkdir mustache-tutorial
cd mustache-tutorial
npm init</pre>
    <p>Hit enter a few times, then:</p>
    <pre class="app-pre">npm install mustache</pre>
    <p>
      Then you can create the <b>template file</b> called <code>letter-template.mustache</code> and put the following
      template in there:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre" style="color: #ff0000;">I hereby greet all my friends.
{{#users}}
  Hello {{name}}
{{/users}}

Nice knowing y'all!</pre>
    <p>
      Now we also need a second file, that specifies who my friends are! So we'll put the friendlist from above in a
      JSON called <code>friends.json</code>
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre" style="color: #0000ff;">{
  "users": [{
    "name": "Hans"
  }, {
    "name": "Fritz"
  }, {
    "name": "Geraldine"
  }]
}</pre>
    <p>
      And now the final step. Combining the <b>template</b> and the <b>data</b>. If you look at the schematics above,
      this is where the templating engine comes into play. With the JavaScript engine, it'll now work like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre">npx mustache friends.json letter-template.mustache > letter.txt</pre>
    <p>
      Now if you look what you have produced (<code>cat letter.txt</code>), you'll see the following:
    </p>
    <pre class="app-pre" style="color: #339966">I hereby greet all my friends.
  Hello Hans
  Hello Fritz
  Hello Geraldine

Nice knowing y'all!
</pre>
    <p>You'll notice, that all the "Hello ..." lines are indented by two spaces. That's because they are also indented
      in the template. So to get rid of those spaces, change the template to:</p>
    <pre class="app-pre" style="color: #ff0000;">I hereby greet all my friends.
{{#users}
Hello {{name}}
{{/users}}

Nice knowing y'all!</pre>
    <p>
      Well, and that's it!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Summarized Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      Grasping the concepts at first isn't easy because there are so many different implementations of Mustache and
      they're often confused with the actual Mustache specification. Yet through a clear separation, the Mustache
      <strong>language </strong>can
      be learned independently, and then the skills can be used together with a <strong>carefully chosen </strong>engine
      (since not all of them are good or adhere to the <a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html">official
      Mustache specs</a>). Thanks for reading the tutorial, I hope you learned a lot, don't forget to subscribe if
      you're
      interested in Web Development and share the post with friends!
