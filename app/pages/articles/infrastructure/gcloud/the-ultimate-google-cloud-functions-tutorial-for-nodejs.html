      At first it helps to see where Google Cloud Functions is in the larger Google Cloud ecosystem. There are the
      following major categories of services that the Google Cloud is offering:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compute</li>
      <li>Storage & Databases</li>
      <li>Networking</li>
      <li>Big Data</li>
      <li>Cloud AI</li>
      <li>Management Tools</li>
      <li>Identity & Security</li>
      <li>IoT</li>
      <li>API Platform</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Soo... pretty much everyhing that you could potentially do in a cloud. It's obvious that in this jungle of
      services it's not always all too easy to find what you need. In order to use any of those services, you'll first
      need (a) an account for the Google Cloud and (b) a project. On account creation, a project "My First Project" will
      be created for you. If you don't have one, just create one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you probably would have guessed, the Google
      Cloud Functions are part of the Compute-Family. The compute family isn't actually too extensive:

             style="border: 1px solid #eee"
             alt="Google Cloud Offering"
             layout="responsive"
             width="578"
             height="550"
             src="/assets/img/the-ultimate-google-cloud-functions-tutorial-for-nodejs/gcloud-compute-offering.png">
    </amp-img>
    <p>
      Also take a look at the icon for cloud functions similar to [...]. Might be helpful for better recognizability. So
      now that we have some sort of compass in the overall Google Cloud ecosystem, let's dive a little deeper into the
      Google Cloud Functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing you'll need to do is enable billing, of course. Then you can get started with creating your first
      cloud function super easily, once you hit "Create Function". You can leave the defaults pretty much as they are,
      let's just give them some more meaningful names. So let's call it the "ultimate-tutorial-function". Notice, that
      the "Function to execute" field must be the same as the name after the "exports". The default is helloWorld, but
      let's change it to ultimateTutorialFunction, so it looks like this:
    </p>
    <amp-img class="create-cloud-function"
             src="/assets/img/the-ultimate-google-cloud-functions-tutorial-for-nodejs/create-new-cloud-function.png"
             width="1156"
             height="896"
             layout="responsive"
             class="app-row-img app-mw500">
    </amp-img>
    <p>
      Now you can just hit create. It'll spin up a cloud function.
    </p>

      This stuff is still so buggy :/
