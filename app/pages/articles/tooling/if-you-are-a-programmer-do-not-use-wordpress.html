      I've written my first blog with Wordpress. I'd consider that a mistake today. Here are my reasons why:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hosting costs are annoying
      </li>
      <li>
        No full control
      </li>
      <li>
        Migration away is not that easy
      </li>
      <li>
        It's not as much fun as programming something yourself
      </li>
      <li>
        No more "Error database connection could not be established" where your whole blog goes down...
      </li>
      <li>
        It's a bit bloated, which is bad for SEO
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since then I've switched to using the AMP framework together with the mustache templating engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolling your own blog isn't that hard. All you need to do is throwing together some HTML files and then throw them at AWS Cloudfront! You'll have a ultra cheap, ultra fast, ultra scalable in no-time!
