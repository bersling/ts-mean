      Yesterday I wanted to convert a snippet of latex code to html. Unfortunately, the results when Googling for "latex
      to html online" are only cr*p. I knew a tool that was really <strong>great </strong>at converting latex <strong>files </strong>to
      html files. This tool is called Pandoc. However, it seemed like a bit of overhead to always <strong>create </strong><strong>a
      file</strong>, store the latex snippet, remember what the pandoc command was to convert, enter the entire command
      (e.g. <code>pandoc mysnippet.tex -o mysnippet.html</code>), open the html file and get the snippet... That's why I'd
      much prefer an online tool that does this chore for me. Since I couldn't find any, I implemented it myself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The result is open sourced, the code can be found on Github at <a href="https://github.com/bersling/latex2html">https://github.com/bersling/latex2html</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It's a small self-contained piece of code with one html file and one TypeScript file at its core.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But here's the interesting part, if I hadn't been so bad at googling, I would have found that there is the exact
      same functionality available at
    </p>
    
    <div class="bers-box">
      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://pandoc.org/try/?text=Here+you+can+convert+Latex+to+HTML.&from=latex&to=html5&standalone=0">https://pandoc.org/try/?text=Here+you+can+convert+Latex+to+HTML.&from=latex&to=html5&standalone=0</a> </strong></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      ... So there might be even a better learning for me than the additional coding experience I gained: Before you
      build something, Google, google, google if it already exists. For example had I tried googling "convert with
      pandoc online" this converter would have been the first hit. For me, it was a small price to pay, since I built
      the solution in little time and it was quite fun, but if you're working on a larger project and didn't research
      what's already out there, you're gonna have a bad time.
