        Warning: This page is outdated. Nobody is actively developing the starter kit. This means that it's not recommended to use this as a starting point for new applications anymore. You can let yourself be inspired by the project, but don't fork it for your new projects.

      What is tsmean?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Getting off the ground with a new webapp isn't easy. Developing the core of an application can take weeks of time. There's a backend and a frontend to be built, each requiring a lot of work. You'll need a sign up and login, a landing page, resource management, a database and so on. Moreover, if you don't do things properly from the beginning, you'll move yourself into a corner where it's hard to get out of. Too many projects that we have seen don't start out modular or with proper architectural foundations, such that it gets harder and harder to maintain over time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Tsmean provides a fully modular and scalable starter kit for your next web-application, <b>fully written in TypeScript</b>. We carefully choose the most proven and promising state-of-the-art technologies for <b>scalable</b> full stack TypeScript web applications. For us, this is a modification of the MEAN stack. Traditionally, the MEAN stack has been MongoDB + ExpressJS + AngularJS (the old one) + Node.JS, everything written in JavaScript. However, AngularJS has been deprecated and <a href="/articles/vs/mongo-vs-mysql-for-webapps/">we're not really fans of MongoDB for WebApps</a>. Also, backends purely written in Express + Node.JS tend to get messy. So the starter uses a <i>modification</i> of the MEAN stack with improved and adjusted technological choices, that make for a maintainable and scalable webapp, fully written in TypeScript. Here's the stack:
    </p>
  
    <amp-img src="/assets/img/tsmean-tech-stack.png"
             alt="Articles"
             class="mwc mw600"
             layout="responsive"
             width="1110"
             height="1114">
    </amp-img>
  
    <p>
      So it's still kind of MEAN: Instead of <b>M</b>ongoDB we offer the choice to use <b>M</b>ySQL,
      instead of bare-bones ExpressJS + Node.JS we use the NestJS framework (which is built on Express and Node) and instead of the old AngularJS of course we use the new Angular framework.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that tsmean is <b>neither</b> a framework <b>nor</b> a library. Tsmean is a <b>starter kit / boilerplate / seed</b>. The difference is that for a framework or library, you don't modify the core. For this starter kit however, you can modify the core. You just download it once and don't have to be compatible with any changes we make in the future. Of course, the starter-kit is going to get better over time, but hopefully it has already spurred your development and you don't need it anymore anyways.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Current project stage</h3>
    <p>
      The project is currently in a <i>pre-alpha</i> stage, which means that only a glimpse of it’s full potential is available today. You <i>could</i> head over to github and download the pre-alpha release now. However, we'd rather recommend you to do one of the following:
    </p>
    
    <div class="primary flex-switch-on-xs">
      <button on="tap:subscribe-to-release-lightbox"
              data-vars-event-category="StarterKit"
              data-vars-event-action="CTA Subscription Form"
              data-vars-event-label="Release Notification"
              data-gtm-tracked
              class="jumbo-button margin-left-right-8 margin-top-bottom-8">
        Get notified on release
      </button>
  
      <a href="/alpha">
        <button data-vars-event-category="StarterKit"
                data-vars-event-action="CTA Subscription Form"
                data-vars-event-label="Alpha Application"
                data-gtm-tracked
                class="jumbo-button margin-left-right-8 margin-top-bottom-8 bordered-inverse">
          Apply for alpha-testing
        </button>
      </a>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Choose <i>alpha-testing</i> if you're the kind of guy or gal that can't wait to get their fingers on something new and likes to <b>actively contribute</b> to a project with feedback. You'll benefit from tight guidance and support in return. Choose to get notified on release, if you just want to get informed once the next public release is out. Either way you'll make sure to profit from all of our work going into the starter kit in the coming months!
