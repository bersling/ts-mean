      Getting of the ground with a new webapp isn't easy. Developing the core of an application can take weeks of time.
      There's a backend and a frontend to be built, each requiring a lot of work. You'll need a sign up & login, a landing page,
      resource management, a database and so on. Moreover, if you don't do things properly in the starting phase, you'll
      move yourself into a corner where it's hard to get out of again. For example most projects I've seen don't start
      out modular, such that they end up with code that's hard to maintain after a year.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since getting started on the right foot is important but hard, we want to help you with this. We've built
      a fully modular and scalable starter kit for your next web-application fully written in TypeScript. It's built on the MEAN stack, meaning
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">M</b>ongoDB or <b class="highlight">M</b>ySQL
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">E</b>xpressJS
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">A</b>ngular2+
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">N</b>odeJS.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We've also put a strong focus on unit testing, such that you don't have to add tests for the core yourself and already have examples on how it's done.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that this is <b>not</b> a framework or a library. The difference is that for a framework or library, you don't modify the core. For this starter kit however, you <i>can</i> modify the core. You just download it once and don't have to be compatible with any changes we make in the future. Of course, the starter-kit is going to get better over time, but hopefully it has already spurred your development and you don't need it anymore anyways. The starter-kit itself, on the other hand, <i>does make use of</i> frameworks and libraries. The only real framework it's using is Angular. The most notable library is ExpressJS, but there are others involved.

      You can see what you're app will look like at <a href="http://demo.tsmean.com" id="intext-link-demo-tsmean">demo.tsmean.com</a>, so you have some idea of what you're getting!
