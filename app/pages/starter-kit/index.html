      What is tsmean?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Getting off the ground with a new webapp isn't easy. Developing the core of an application can take weeks of time. There's a backend and a frontend to be built, each requiring a lot of work. You'll need a sign up & login, a landing page, resource management, a database and so on. Moreover, if you don't do things properly in the starting phase, you'll move yourself into a corner where it's hard to get out of again. For example too many projects we've seen don't start out modular, such that they end up with code that's hard to maintain after a year.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We are building a fully modular and scalable starter kit for your next web-application, <b>fully written in TypeScript</b>. It's built on the MEAN stack, meaning
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">M</b>ongoDB or <b class="highlight">M</b>ySQL
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">E</b>xpressJS
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">A</b>ngular2+
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">N</b>odeJS.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      That's why it's called tsmean (TypeScript + Mongo / Mysql + Express + Angular + Node.js)!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that this is <b>not</b> a framework or a library. This is a starter kit / boilerplate / seed. The difference is that for a framework or library, you don't modify the core. For this starter kit however, you can modify the core. You just download it once and don't have to be compatible with any changes we make in the future. Of course, the starter-kit is going to get better over time, but hopefully it has already spurred your development and you don't need it anymore anyways.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Current project stage</h3>
    <p>
      The project is currently in a <i>pre-alpha</i> stage, which means that only a glimpse of it’s full potential is available today. You <i>could</i> head over to github and download the pre-alpha release now. However, we'd rather recommend you to do one of the following:
    </p>
    
    <div class="primary flex-switch-on-xs">
      <button on="tap:subscribe-to-release-lightbox"
              class="jumbo-button margin-left-right-8 margin-top-bottom-8">
        Get notified on release
      </button>
  
      <a href="/alpha">
        <button class="jumbo-button margin-left-right-8 margin-top-bottom-8 bordered-inverse">
          Apply for alpha-testing
        </button>
      </a>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Choose <i>alpha-testing</i> if you're the kind of guy or gal that can't wait to get their fingers on something new and likes to <b>actively contribute</b> to a project with feedback. You'll benefit from tight guidance and support in return. Choose to get notified on release, if you just want to get informed once the next public release is out. Either way you'll make sure to profit from all of our work going into the starter kit in the coming months!
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Installing the pre-alpha release
    </h3>
  
    <p>
      There's a demo of the web app you're getting when downloading the code at
      <b><a href="http://demo.tsmean.com">demo.tsmean.com</a></b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the prerequisits are met (git, node, ts-mean & angular-cli installed), you can simply run the following commands in your terminal:
    </p>
    
    <pre>git clone https://github.com/tsmean/tsmean your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm install</pre>
    
    <p>
      This may take a while, since the starter kit is highly modular and consits of multiple modules, which each run against a small test app themselves. Since projects created with Angular Cli are quite heavy, setting up all of those test applications will take a while.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Once the installation process has finished, you can test if everything is working. To check if the backend is working as expected, it's best if you simply
    </p>
    
    <pre>cd backend
npm test</pre>
    
    <p>
      This will run the unit tests. For the frontend, you can fire up the main module using:
    </p>
    
    <pre>cd frontend/main
ng serve</pre>

    <p>
      Now you should be able to view the app at <a href="http://localhost:4200">localhost:4200</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Next steps
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      You can start messing around with the code now. All the modules have their separate readme's and can basically be developed on their own. You can also check the code directly on <b><a href="https://github.com/tsmean/tsmean" target="_blank">Github</a></b> or file issues there. You're also welcome to honor our efforts by gracing the project with a glorious Github star.
    </p>
