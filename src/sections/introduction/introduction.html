<p>
  This project strives to provide a state-of-the art boilerplate for the MEAN stack (MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node)
  fully written in typescript. Another requirement of this project is 100% coverage with unit tests (also written in typescript!)
  for the boilerplate code. The whole boilerplate / seed is available on Github.

  However, sometimes it helps to build something from scratch. For example if you only want the very basics, you could
  leave away the the authentication. Therefore this page contains step-by-step instructions (a tutorial, if you will) on how this boilerplate code is setup.
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>
  Why am I motivated to build this boilerplate code?
  The MEAN stack was quite popular for a while, but it lost a bit of interest since the original projects
  aren't maintained very well. Yet, the stack might still be a good choice for some people. Here's what I see
  as its main advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Just one language back to front.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Modularity. Don't like Mongo? Switch it out with a SQL database. That's the strong case against frameworks like MeteorJS.
  </li>
</ul>

Having said this, I'd also like to warn you about this stack at this point. I think MongoDB is not the best choice
to back your web-app with, here are my reasons why:

</a>
<p>
  Second, if your reason for choosing this stack is that you need node / javascript for its asynchronous nature
  to have a non-blocking server that can handle thousands of concurrent requests, I'd like to
  point out that this isn't exclusive to node / javascript. It's also possible to write non-blocking code
  in other languages and frameworks. It's just that people usually don't write their code async-style,
  thus you will find less packages & community discussions to help you out.
