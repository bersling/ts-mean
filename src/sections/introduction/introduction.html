  Introduction

<p>
  This project strives to provide a state-of-the art boilerplate for the MEAN stack (MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node)
  fully written in typescript. Another requirement of this project is 100% coverage with unit tests (also written in typescript!)
  for the boilerplate code. The whole boilerplate / seed is available on Github.

  However, sometimes it helps to build something from scratch. For example if you only want the very basics, you could
  leave away the the authentication. Therefore this page contains step-by-step instructions (a tutorial, if you will) on how this boilerplate code is setup.

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>
  Why am I motivated to build this boilerplate code? What do I think the world will get from it?
  For one, the MEAN stack was quite popular for a while, but it lost a bit of interest since the original projects
  aren't maintained very well. Yet, the stack might still be a good choice for some. It certainly offers some advantages over other choices:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Just one language back to front.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modularity. Don't like Mongo? Switch it out with a SQL database. That's the strong case against frameworks like MeteorJS.
  </li>
  <li>
    Node. Node may be an advantage or a disadvantage, that you'll have to decide for yourself. To shortly summarize:
    it complicates programming (callback hell) but is good in "high throughput" scenarios (which you'll probably never reach).
  </li>
</ul>
