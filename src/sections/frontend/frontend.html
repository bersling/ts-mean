  Frontend
</h1>

<p>
  The Angular Cli does a good job at scaffolding your new web-app. However, I have still
  built a small frontend to illustrate how you would use it together with the backend we've built so far.
  Also I'd like to illustrate some points with this frontend about my views on things like state-management
  and a good directory setup. Last but not least, it's nice to have an complete working app, so you don't
  have to build things like login etc. yourself.
</p>

<p>
  Since the project is close to most Angular Tutorials out there, I'm just pointing out here what's different about the frontend.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    State management is done partly with services as as front-end data-store. Read more about my views on state management here:
    <a href="https://www.bersling.com/2017/05/24/manage-state-in-angular-2/">https://www.bersling.com/2017/05/24/manage-state-in-angular-2/</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Directory structure separates components, services, pipes and models.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I think those are the most important differences to point out. You can check out the full code at:

  On developing a frontend with Angular there are already a lot of good resources and there is
  also a cool scaffolding tool, the <code>angular-cli</code>. What still would be useful would be a small demonstration
  on how to connect Angular to the backend we've built now.
</p>

<p>
  We're going to scaffold the application with the <code>angular-cli</code>. Install it with the command
</p>
<pre class="code-snippet">
npm install -g @angular/cli
</pre>
<p>
  and create a new frontend-project with
</p>
<pre class="code-snippet">
ng new <span class="highlight">project-name</span>
mv <span class="highlight">project-name</span>
cd frontend
ng serve
</pre>
<p>
  You now have the frontend running on port <code>4200</code>,
  go check it in your browser at <a href="http://localhost:4200">http://localhost:4200</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Our small example will closely lean on the heroes tutorial from the Angular page, just strapping it to a real database
  and fitting it to our backend.
</p>

<pre class="codesnippet">
ng g component create-hero
ng g component delete-hero
ng g component display-hero
ng g component display-hero-list
ng g interface resource
ng g interface hero
ng g service resource
</pre>

<p>
  What kind of hero are we talking about? Let's just say it looks like this (add this code to <code>hero.ts</code>):
</p>

<div class="file-label">frontend/src/app/hero.ts</div>
<pre class="code-snippet">{{> ./sections/frontend/hero.ts.html}}</pre>

<p>
  while the generic resource it extends looks like this
</p>

<div class="file-label">frontend/src/app/resource.ts</div>
<pre class="code-snippet">{{> ./sections/frontend/resource.ts.html}}</pre>

<p>
  Then in <code>frontend/src/app/app.module.ts</code> you need to provide the service: In providers,
  add <code>heroService</code> and import it at the top (<code>import {HeroService} from "./hero.service";</code>).
  Since everything relies on the backend, establishing the connection to it isn't a bad place to start our
  frontend development. That's a classical use case of a service in Angular. In order to connect to the backend,
  we need a service that looks like this
</p>




<p>
  We'll start with the <code>create-hero</code> component. First make sure it's working as expected and add
  <code>&lt;app-create-hero&gt;</code> in the <code>frontent/src/app/app.component.ts</code>.
  <strong>Note</strong> that the component name is preceeded with app, <code>angular-cli</code> does this for namespacing reasons.
  You should now see
  "create-hero works!" below the "app works" in your browser. Now let's change this with actual code.
  Let's say our hero looks like this:
</p>


<p>
  Then we will need something to enter the description of the hero, meaning input field.
  Thus our <code>create-hero</code> would look somewhat like this
</p-->
