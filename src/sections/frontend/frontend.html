  Frontend
</h1>
<p>
  On developing a frontend with Angular there are actually already tons of good resources and there's
  also an amazing scaffolding tool the <code>angular-cli</code>. What still would be useful would be a small demonstration
  on how to connect Angular to the backend we've built now.
</p>

<p>
  We're going to scaffold the application with the <code>angular-cli</code>. Install it with the command
</p>
<pre class="code-snippet">
npm install -g @angular/cli
</pre>
<p>
  and create a new frontend-project with
</p>
<pre class="code-snippet">
ng new <span class="highlight">project-name</span>
mv <span class="highlight">project-name</span>
cd frontend
ng serve
</pre>
<p>
  You now have the frontend running on port <code>4200</code>,
  go check it in your browser at <a href="http://localhost:4200">http://localhost:4200</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Our small example will closely lean on the heroes tutorial from the Angular page, just strapping it to a real database
  and fitting it to our backend.
</p>

<pre class="codesnippet">
ng g component create-hero
ng g component delete-hero
ng g component display-hero
ng g component display-hero-list
ng g interface resource
ng g interface hero
ng g service resource
</pre>

<p>
  What kind of hero are we talking about? Let's just say it looks like this (add this code to <code>hero.ts</code>):
</p>

<div class="file-label">frontend/src/app/hero.ts</div>
<pre class="code-snippet">{{> ./sections/frontend/hero.ts.html}}</pre>

<p>
  while the generic resource it extends looks like this
</p>

<div class="file-label">frontend/src/app/resource.ts</div>
<pre class="code-snippet">{{> ./sections/frontend/resource.ts.html}}</pre>

<p>
  Then in <code>frontend/src/app/app.module.ts</code> you need to provide the service: In providers,
  add <code>heroService</code> and import it at the top (<code>import {HeroService} from "./hero.service";</code>).
  Since everything relies on the backend, establishing the connection to it isn't a bad place to start our
  frontend development. That's a classical use case of a service in Angular. In order to connect to the backend,
  we need a service that looks like this
</p>




<p>
  We'll start with the <code>create-hero</code> component. First make sure it's working as expected and add
  <code>&lt;app-create-hero&gt;</code> in the <code>frontent/src/app/app.component.ts</code>.
  <strong>Note</strong> that the component name is preceeded with app, <code>angular-cli</code> does this for namespacing reasons.
  You should now see
  "create-hero works!" below the "app works" in your browser. Now let's change this with actual code.
  Let's say our hero looks like this:
</p>


<p>
  Then we will need something to enter the description of the hero, meaning input field.
  Thus our <code>create-hero</code> would look somewhat like this
</p>
