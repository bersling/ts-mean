  Frontend
</h1>

<p>
  The Angular Cli does a good job at scaffolding your new web-app. However, I have still
  built a small frontend to illustrate how you would use it together with the backend we've built so far.
  Also I'd like to illustrate some points with this frontend about my views on things like state-management
  and a good directory setup. Last but not least, it's nice to have an complete working app, so you don't
  have to build things like login etc. yourself.
</p>

<p>
  Since the project is close to most Angular Tutorials out there, I'm just pointing out here what's different about the frontend.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    State management is done partly with services as as front-end data-store. Read more about my views on state management here:

  </li>
  <li>
    Directory structure separates components, services, pipes and models.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I think those are the most important differences to point out. You can check out the full code at:
