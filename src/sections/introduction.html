  This project strives to provide a state-of-the art boilerplate for the MEAN stack (MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node)
  fully written in typescript. Another requirement of this project is 100% coverage with unit tests (also written in typescript!)
  for the boilerplate code. The whole boilerplate / seed is available on Github.

  However, sometimes it helps to build something from scratch. For example if you only want the very basics, you could
  leave away the the authentication. Therefore this page contains step-by-step instruction on how this boilerplate code is setup.
