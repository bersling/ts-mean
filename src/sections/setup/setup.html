<h1>
  Basic Setup
</h1>

<p>
  To get started, first create the folder structure. Create your project folder:
</p>
<pre class="code-snippet">
mkdir <span class="highlight">project-name</span>
cd <span class="highlight">project-name</span>
mkdir backend
cd backend
</pre>
<p>
  Replace the red bits with your own values.
</p>

<p>
  Then, first you'll need a <code>package.json</code>:
</p>
<div class="file-label">
  package.json
</div>
<pre class="code-snippet">{{> ./sections/setup/package.json.html}}</pre>

<p>
  As we progress, we'll install some more packages, but that's it for now.
</p>

<p>
  Now you're ready to install those dependencies. Simply run
</p>
<pre class="code-snippet">
npm install
</pre>

<p>
  Now we're going to setup a logger and write a test for it. You could simply use
  <code>console.log</code> for logging, but with a logger you have some more functionalities at your disposal,
  such as disabling some logs under some circumstances (e.g. in production mode).
</p>

<p>
  Create a the directory for the logger
</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">
mkdir src
cd src
mkdir logger
</pre>

<p>
  and also the logger file and corresponding test:
</p>
<div class="file-label">src/logger/logger.ts</div>
<pre class="code-snippet">{{> ./sections/setup/logger.ts.html}}</pre>

<div class="file-label">src/logger/logger.test.ts</div>
<pre class="code-snippet">{{> ./sections/setup/logger.test.ts.html}}</pre>

<p>
  Maybe some of you ask now "but why do I need this wrapper, I could use winston directly?". Well, in my experience
  it almost always paid of to write a wrapper. Like this, you can switch out the implementation of the logger easily.
  For example when winston becomes deprecated, switching to another logger library is much simpler. Also working with typescript
  and IntelliJ makes this quite comfortable since writing <code>log</code> and then hitting <code>alt + enter</code>
  will automatically import the logger!
</p>

<p>
  Now that you've finished this part, let's check if everything is working. Run
</p>
<pre class="code-snippet">
  npm test
</pre>
<p>
  This should result in a working test and look somewhat like this:
</p>
<div class="standard-image-wrapper">
  <amp-img src="/img/first-test.png" layout="responsive" alt="Config Test should work" height="20rem" width="50rem"></amp-img>
</div>
