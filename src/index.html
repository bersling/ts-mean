      This project strives to provide a state-of-the art <b>starter kit</b> for your next web-app.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      It's using the MEAN stack,
      which stands for
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">M</b>ongoDB
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">E</b>xpressJS
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">A</b>ngular2+
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="highlight">N</b>odeJS.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      I also added a <b class="highlight">M</b>ySQL database layer,
      for those of you who
      <a href="https://www.bersling.com/2017/06/02/please-dont-use-mongodb-or-any-other-nosql-database-for-your-web-app">
        prefer SQL to NoSQL for web-apps
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here comes the cool thing about this project: <b>It's completely written in typescript.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another requirement of this project is "100% test coverage" (also written in typescript!)
      for the starter kit.
      The project is available on Github!
    </p>
  
    <br>
    <div class="github-link-wrapper">
      <a href="https://github.com/tsmean/tsmean" class="github-link">
        <amp-img src="/img/github-icon.svg" height="32" width="32" class="github-image" alt="Github Logo"></amp-img>
        <span class="github-text">
          Get Seed on Github
        </span>
      </a>
    </div>
    <br>
  
    <p>
      Or maybe you are not conviced yet using the tsmean starter kit is a good idea? Then read on.
    </p>
  
    <h2>
      Why Typescript, why MEAN, why <span class="highlight">tsmean</span>?
    </h2>
  
    <p>
      The MEAN stack was quite popular for a while, but it lost a bit of interest since the original projects
      aren't maintained anymore. Yet, I still think it's an incredible stack, now even more than ever. I see the main advantage in that there
      is just one language back to front. This brings efficiency gains through consistency:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All team members can develop fullstack
      </li>
      <li>
        No context switching
      </li>
      <li>
        Same packaging solutions, for example npm
      </li>
      <li>
        Sharing code between backend and frontend (models, functions, ...)
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      The only problem with Javascript historically was, that it sucked. So why would you sacrifice good old Java, just to write
      crappy Javascript <i>everywhere</i>? Yet, with the advancements of Javascript and for me specifically with <b>Typescript</b>,
      one language everywhere became really appealing.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Additionally, compared to other fullstackJS solutions (e.g. MeteorJS), I think this stack comes with a more modular design.
      Don't like MongoDB? Just switch it out with another database.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Let's investigate each part of "MEAN" a bit more in detail. So the "M" I've already
      mentioned I actually lean more towards the MqSQL solution that the Mongo solution. With the routing, ExpressJS,
      I don't really have any strong opinion on this one. I guess one could also use hapi or something similar.
      Then for the frontend, for one, Angular2+ is my favourite and for another, it has the strongest
      Typescript community. The "N" in the stack is pretty obvious as there aren't any real viable alternatives
      for running JS on the server as far as I know. So overall the MEAN stack is surely one of the strongest choices
      if you want to go with typescript everywhere.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      There's also a second dimension to this starterkit. While the first one was the lack of exemplary code
      for typescript on the server, the second one would be that <b class="highlight">every webapp is roughly the same</b>.
      Every webapp has users. Every webapp has a login. Every webapp has a "main thing it revolves around" (posts for facebook,
      videos for youtube, images for instagram, todos for a todo list app, heroes in the hero app...).
      And the core of the webapp is usually
      providing "different lists of the main thing" (timeline, playlist, ...).
      Developing this core usually takes weeks of time. That's why there are things like Hackathon Starter Kits.
      But for one, there isn' any other good starter kit for a fullstack <b>typescript</b> webapp out there.
      And for another, this isn't something hacky.
      This is a starter for <b>your next real webapp</b>.
      It's got modularity, scalability and testability
      baked into it's design, so you can get started on the right foot.
