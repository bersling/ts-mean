  <b class="highlight">tsmean</b> is your go-to place for your next fullstack typescript webapp.

<p>
  tsmean uses the MEAN stack,
  which stands for
<ul>
  <li>
    <b class="highlight">M</b>ongoDB or <b class="highlight">M</b>ySQL
  </li>
  <li>
    <b class="highlight">E</b>xpressJS
  </li>
  <li>
    <b class="highlight">A</b>ngular2+
  </li>
  <li>
    <b class="highlight">N</b>odeJS.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  On this page, resources for fullstack typescript development are offered. Additionally,
  a starter-kit is available on Github!

<h2>
  Why TypeScript, why MEAN, why <span class="highlight">tsmean</span>?

<p>
  To understand how we came to this point in 2017, where it's a good idea to use the tsmean stack,
  we first need to roll up a bit of history.

<h3>
  Different languages

<p>
  Have you ever wondered, why backends are written in Java or Python and frontends are written in Javascript?
  Doesn't that seem inefficient to you, to use different languages across one and the same project?
  Especially in smaller teams,
  this language barrier often builds a wall between backend and frontend developers
  and artificially pushes people into one of those categories.
  I mean, compare it to real languages, isn't it useful that English is the de facto standard in the development community?
  Wouldn't it also be useful if everyone would speak the same programming language?
</p>

  First steps towards compatibility

</h3>
<p>
  For the frontend we basically don't have any other choice than to use Javascript,
  since this is the only language that the browser understands.
  For a long time <i>only</i> browsers would speak Javascript,
  meaning you didn't even have the possibility to write Javascript for the backend.
  Along came Node.js in 2009, finally making it possible to also write JS on the server.
  Not only did it make it possible, but it provided some real advantages compared to other languages.
  Due to the non-blocking nature of Javascript,
  web-servers written in Node.js could be more resource efficient than their Java or  Python counterparts.
  However, since Javascript doesn't have the best reputation in terms of scalability (no types, callback hell, ....),
  the cost of maintenance drastically increased for larger projects.
  Developers were glad that they <i>could</i> write in a different language server-side and so fullstack-Javascript
  only gained adoption for some few projects.
</p>

<h3>
  A new star on the horizon
  <amp-img src="/img/landing/006-shooting-star-1.svg"
           alt="TypeScript Mean Banner"

</h3>
<p>
  Remember how I said you don't have another choice for the frontend than Javascript?
  Well, that was a lie. You just need something that <i>compiles</i> to Javascript. In 2012 Microsoft released
  TypeScript, an optionally-typed language that does exactly this. The promise was better scalability and maintainability
  for larter projects.
</p>
<p>
  At first, TypeScript it was full of bugs and you needed to be a compiler yourself to spot all the places where
  TypeScript would fail. Since then a lot has changed and nowadays you can trust TypeScript
  to do good work. This has led to a strong TypeScript-trend in the frontend world. Here's the Google-Trends chart
  for TypeScript from mid 2012 to mid 2017:
</p>

<div>
  <amp-img src="/img/landing/tstrend.png"
           alt="TypeScript Mean Banner"
           class="tstrend"
           layout="responsive"
           width="832"
           height="402">
  </amp-img>
</div>

<p>
  But TypeScript isn't just a better alternative to JavaScript.
  It is actually a good programming language overall! Roughly 20 years after the
  internet hit mainstream, it finally makes sense to talk one language back to front.
  Now developers can talk to each other. And projects can share code between backend and frontend.
  And you don't have to switch context anymore. And you can use the same package management solutions.
  Apply the same knowledge to build libraries. And finally this all comes in a sane and scalable language.

<p>
  The bad news is, that we are still at the very beginning of this journey.
  The developments are still very young and there are only few good resources on
  server-side TypeScript development. It totally makes sense to write fullstack TypeScript,
  but you are an early adopter with this. This makes it really tough to get started.
  Which frameworks should you use? What are best practices?
</p>

<p>
  This is where tsmean tries to alleviate some of the pain. Basically tsmean provides two things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Written resources on fullstack typescript development.
    Tutorials, comparisons, experiences. You can find all links to the resources below.
  </li>
  <li>
    A starter kit for a fullstack typescript webapp.
    Developing the core of a wepapp requires a lot of work. Either you "hack it" and manoeuvre
    yourself into big trouble for later on, or you do it right, and you'll spend weeks.
    tsmean provides the common core of every fullstack webapp.
    It is not a framework, you can change all the code.
    It is rather a fully functional,
    well-engineered, scalable and module template for you to get started faster.
    Here's what you get when you download the starter kit: <a href="demo.tsmean.com">demo.tsmean.com</a>.
    The code is hosted  <a href="https://github.com/tsmean/tsmean">here</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
