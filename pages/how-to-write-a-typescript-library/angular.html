    <h2>How to write an Angular Library</h2>
    
    <p>
      <i>
        This tutorial is from mid 2017 and works for Angular 2 as well as Angular 4.
      </i>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since AngularCLI nor any of the official Angular resources
      offer a straightforward way, I've composed my own tutorial on how to write an Angular library.
      <b>Note: This tutorial describes how to publish typescript sources to npm. The library will only
        work for Angular projects written in typescript!</b> I don't compile to javascript
      plus d.ts files, because after hours of trying I was on the brink
      of throwing my notebook out the window. It was too annoying with rollup, umd,
      MyLibraryModule not found, index.ts names, long waiting times with "yarning" and "ng serving",
      inlining html and css, crazy tsconfig.json's with deprecated flags, no good local development environment, working version
      in local project but breaking when published and so on.
      But since a majority of the community uses typescript anyways and it's
      not my fault that it's so damn hard to publish a working library, I'm just going to publish typescript sources,
      which works like a charm.
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 1:</span> Create a new project with the AngularCli</h2>
    <p>
      Create a new project. This will be a wrapper and consumer for your library module.
      I am going to call my library <code>libex</code> (for "library-example", and it was still free on npm)
      so I call the new project <code>libex-project</code>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-snippet">ng new libex-project  <span class="highlight">--prefix libex</span></pre>
    
    <p>
      Use your library title instead of libex. Prefix is what you'll write in front of your components, for example
      if I have a <code>HelloComponent</code> it will be used by <code>libex-hello</code> now.
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 2:</span> Create a new module</h2>
    
    <p>
      Your library will reside in it's own module. But first we've got to create said module.
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet">ng g module libex</pre>
    
    <p>Then we <code>cd</code> into that folder.</p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet"><code>cd src/app/libex/</code></pre>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 3:</span> Build your library module</h2>
    <p>Create components, services etc., e.g.</p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet">ng g component hello</pre>
    
    <p>When you're done, you'll have to <strong class="highlight">export</strong> the desired components:</p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet">@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: [HelloComponent],
  <span class="highlight">exports: [HelloComponent]</span>
})</pre>
    <p>You can use your <code>AppModule</code> to test the library:</p>
    <pre class="code-snippet"><code>...
imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  LibexModule
],</code></pre>
    <p>If you need singleton services, you should modify your library module like so:</p>
    <pre class="code-snippet">@NgModule({
  providers: [ /* Don't add the services here */ ]
})
export class LibexModule {
  static forRoot() {
    return {
      ngModule: LibexModule,
      providers: [ SomeService ]
    }
  }
}</pre>
    <p>and change the imports in <code>AppModule</code> to:</p>
    <pre class="code-snippet"><code>...
imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  LibexModule.forRoot()
],</code></pre>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 4:</span> Publish</h2>
    
    <p>
      In your module folder, create a new <code>package.json</code>. You could do this with the <code>npm init</code>
      command. It should look somewhat like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet">{
  "name": "libex",
  "version": "1.0.16",
  "description": "An Example Library.",
      ...
}
</pre>
    
    <p>
      Basically only the library name matters. <b>Also rename <code>libex.module.ts</code> to <code>index.ts</code>
      since that's the standard name for a main file.</b>
      Now since we're just publishing the typescript sources (note: that means your library will only work for
      consumers that <b>also</b> use typescript), we're ready to publish. Just run <code>npm publish</code>!
      You can also add a <code>.npmignore</code> so you publish only exactly what's needed, it works like .gitignore,
      just for npm.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What's also an option is to re-export some files from index.ts. For example <code>export * from './hello.service'</code>,
      since then the consumer can just write <code>import { HelloService } from 'libex'</code> instead of
      <code>import { HelloService } from 'libex/hello.service'</code>. On the other hand, this can also
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38000323/3022127">lead to problems</a>,
      so I usually refrain from it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In case your library requires other libraries, you can also install them in your library module's folder and to
      the <code>package.json</code> we've just created. Just run <code>npm install --save something</code> from
      the library folder.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For subsequent releases, <code>npm version patch</code> (or <code>minor</code> or <code>major</code>) and then <code>npm publish</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Well and that's it, now you have your library, which you can develop & test locally
      and publish to npm!
    </p>
